# **Library Lending System  

## Project Overview  
The Library Lending System is a **Ruby on Rails** web application that allows users to:  
- **Manage books** (create, update, delete, view).  
- **Borrow books** with a specified duration.  
- **Return books** and calculate penalties for overdue returns.  
- **View borrowing and return history** for users and books.  

This project follows the **MVC pattern** and uses **ERB templates** for the frontend.
